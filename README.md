# Black-Jack-Game

Blackjack is a popular card game, often played in casinos, where the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21. It is also known as "21." The game is played with one or more standard decks of 52 cards.
Card Values in Blackjack:
Number cards (2-10): Face value (e.g., 5 = 5 points).
Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): 10 points each.
Ace: Either 1 point or 11 points, depending on what benefits the hand more.
Winning Blackjack:
A player wins in Blackjack under the following conditions:

** Blackjack:**

If the player's first two cards total 21 (an Ace + any 10-point card, such as a King, Queen, Jack, or 10).
This is called a "Blackjack" and usually pays out at 3:2 odds (e.g., a $10 bet wins $15 in addition to the original bet).

**Higher Hand Value than the Dealer:**

The player’s hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21.

**Dealer Busts:**

If the dealer’s hand exceeds 21, the dealer "busts," and the player automatically wins (if the player hasn’t already busted).

**Losing Blackjack:**

A player loses in Blackjack if:

Their hand value exceeds 21 (they "bust").
The dealer’s hand value is closer to 21 than the player’s hand.
The dealer has a "Blackjack" and the player does not.

**Tie in Blackjack:**

If the player and dealer have the same hand value (including Blackjack), it is a push (tie), and the player's bet is returned.
